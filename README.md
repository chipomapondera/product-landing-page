# product-landing-page
In this project I demonstrate my knowledge of  HTML + CSS to build a Product Landing Page for a cupcake shop.

This is a project from the freeCodeCamp HTML + CSS tutorials. See the project brief here: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/
